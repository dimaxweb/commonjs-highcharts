# highchart-commonjs
Deprecated in favor of [highcharts-release](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-release)

This is a simple wrapper for highcharts that allows using it with webpack.

The reason why this project is better is because little robot updates this package regularly with the latest version of highcharts. 

# Installation

```bash
npm install commonjs-highcharts --save
```

# Usage

`require('highcharts-commonjs')`
